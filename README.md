# Validation of ns3 implementation of TCP-Westwood
<h3>Computer Networks Course Project.</h3>
Brief: TCP Westwood is designed to improve the performance of TCP in wireless networks. It estimates the available bandwidth in the network to adjust its cwnd. In this project, the aim isto validate ns-3 TCP Westwood implementation by comparing the results obtained from it to those obtained by simulating Linux TCP Westwood.
Required experience: C and C++. <br>
Bonus experience: Knowledge of TCP Westwood and TCP implementation in ns-3. <br>
Difficulty: Moderate.<br>
